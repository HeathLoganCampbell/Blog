    <h1>Dark forest hypothesis</h1>
    <p>
      Putting your voice into the darkness is the scare 
      thought special if something greater than yourself answers back.
      So it's easier to just not post anything, upload anything, say anything.

    <p>
      There is a theory out there in the world called the dark forest hypothesis which tries to explain
      why we are alone in this universe. summarising as "any space-faring civilization would view any other intelligent life as an inevitable threat and thus destroy any nascent life that makes itself known"
      which for the majority of my life I have applied to the internet. feeling uncomfortable even revealing my name for many years.

      This view point might be faulted. As it's just a pure negative one.
